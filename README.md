# Sparx-Kali

This is my from-scratch build for a kali docker instance to deploy on the fly.
rather than build the image headless from the install files, I'm choosing to
learn about each tool as I add it. In this way I hope to gain more hands on
experience with the deployment and use-case for every tool I add to my custom
build, as well as short-circuiting the sheer anxiety of facing the daunting array
of tools that come prepacked into a normal kali install.
